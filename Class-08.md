# Retrospective


## What went well, that I might forget if I donâ€™t write down?

Mastered object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts and applied them in projects.
Collaborated effectively in team projects using Git and GitHub for version control.
Developed strong data manipulation skills with various data structures like queue and stack.
Received positive feedback on code clarity and organization.



## What did I learn today?
stacks and queues:

|     | Stack                                   | Queue                                        |
|-----|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Order | Last-In-First-Out (LIFO)                | First-In-First-Out (FIFO)                     |
| Insertion  | Pushed onto the top                     | Enqueued at the rear                          |
| Removal    | Popped from the top                      | Dequeued from the front                        |
| Access     | Top element                              | Front and rear elements                       |
| Time Complexity | Push, Pop, Peek: O(1)                  | Enqueue, Dequeue, Peek: O(1)                  |
| Usage     | Undo/Redo, expression evaluation, recursion | Scheduling, breadth-first search, buffer management |
| Implementation | Array, linked list, etc.               | Array, linked list, etc.                      |



## What should I do differently next time?

- Improve time management to meet deadlines and complete tasks more efficiently.
- Actively participate in group discussions and ask questions to enhance learning.
- Practice coding regularly to reinforce concepts and improve problem-solving skills.
- Take advantage of additional resources outside of the bootcamp, such as online tutorials or coding exercises, to supplement your learning.
- Reflect on feedback received and work on areas for improvement.
- Stay motivated and maintain a growth mindset, embracing challenges as opportunities for learning and growth.


## What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?

- Advanced topics such as advanced data structures, algorithm design and analysis, or advanced Python libraries and frameworks.
- Improving debugging and troubleshooting skills.
- Learning software engineering best practices, coding standards, and design patterns.
- Exploring industry-relevant technologies or tools to broaden career opportunities.
- Gaining experience in collaborative development and working on larger projects.
- Developing soft skills such as communication, networking, and teamwork.
