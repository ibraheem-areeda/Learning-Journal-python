# Stacks and Queues
Stacks and queues are both abstract data types (ADTs) that organize and store data elements. They differ in how they operate and prioritize the access and removal of elements.

**Stack:**
- A stack is a data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle.
- Elements are added and removed from the same end, known as the top of the stack.
- The most recently added element is the first one to be removed.
- The operations available for a stack are:
   - **Push**: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
   - **Pop**: Removes the top element from the stack.
   - **Peek**: Retrieves the top element without removing it.
- Stacks are often used for implementing undo/redo functionality, expression evaluation, recursive algorithms, etc.

**Queue:**
- A queue is a data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle.
- Elements are added at one end, known as the rear or back, and removed from the other end, known as the front.
- The oldest element is the first one to be removed.
- The operations available for a queue are:
   - **Enqueue**: Adds an element to the rear of the queue.
   - **Dequeue**: Removes the front element from the queue.
   - **Peek**: Retrieves the front element without removing it.
- Queues are often used for implementing scheduling, breadth-first search, buffer management, etc.

Differences between Stacks and Queues:

1. **Ordering**: Stacks follow the LIFO order, while queues follow the FIFO order.
2. **Insertion and Removal**: In a stack, both insertion and removal happen at the top. In a queue, insertion happens at the rear, and removal happens at the front.
3. **Access**: Stacks allow access to only the topmost element, while queues allow access to both the front and rear elements.
4. **Usage**: Stacks are useful when you need to track a single current state or perform depth-first processing. Queues are suitable for scenarios where you want to process items in the order they were added or perform breadth-first processing.

Both stacks and queues have their unique applications, and choosing between them depends on the specific requirements of the problem you are solving.
