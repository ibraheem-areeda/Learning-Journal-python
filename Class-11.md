# imposter syndrome 
On a scale from 1 (least) to 10 (most), to what extent do you experience these feelings(imposter syndrome)?
6

 Have you always felt the way you do now?
 yes
 
 if you have successfully lowered the number youâ€™d use to rate your Imposter Syndrome, how have you done so?
 working on it
 
 # numpy
NumPy is a Python library that provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and efficient mathematical operations on these arrays. It is widely used in scientific computing, data analysis, and numerical computations due to its powerful features, including N-dimensional arrays, mathematical functions, broadcasting, linear algebra operations, and integration with other libraries. NumPy enables fast and efficient numerical computations in Python.

### numpy methods we learnt today 
 - `np.array` : function is used to create a new ndarray object, which is a multi-dimensional array. The np.array function takes in a sequence-like object (such as a list or tuple) as its argument and returns an ndarray representing the input data.
 - `np.genfromtxt` :function in NumPy is used to load data from a text file or a CSV file into an ndarray. It provides a convenient way to read and parse structured data from files and convert it into a NumPy array.
 - `array.shape` : attribute is used to determine the dimensions or shape of an ndarray. It returns a tuple representing the size of each dimension of the array.
 - `np.mean`: function is used to calculate the arithmetic mean or average of elements in an ndarray along a specified axis or for the entire array.
 - `np.median`: function is used to calculate the median value of elements in an ndarray along a specified axis or for the entire array.
 
 ### Image processing
 ```
 import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
 import matplotlib.image as mpimg
 ```
  imports the necessary modules from Matplotlib for plotting and working with images.
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt imports the pyplot module from Matplotlib, which provides a MATLAB-like interface for creating plots and visualizations.
import matplotlib.image as mpimg imports the image module from Matplotlib, which provides functions for reading, displaying, and manipulating images.
Once these modules are imported, you can use them in your code for plotting and working with images.
