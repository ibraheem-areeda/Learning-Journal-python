### Dependency Injection
Dependency Injection in Python is a design pattern that helps decouple classes by injecting their dependencies from external sources. This can be achieved through constructor injection, setter injection, property injection, or by using a dependency injection framework. The main goal is to improve code maintainability, testability, and flexibility by removing direct dependencies between classes.

Here's a simple example of Dependency Injection using constructor injection in Python:

```python
class Logger:
    def log(self, message):
        print(f"Logging: {message}")


class User:
    def __init__(self, logger):
        self.logger = logger

    def register(self, username):
        self.logger.log(f"User '{username}' registered.")


# Create an instance of the Logger class
logger = Logger()

# Inject the logger dependency into the User class
user = User(logger)

# Use the User instance
user.register("John")
```

In this example, we have a `Logger` class that handles logging messages. The `User` class has a dependency on the `Logger` class, which is injected via its constructor. When registering a user, the `User` instance uses the injected logger to log a message.

By injecting the `Logger` dependency into the `User` class, we achieve loose coupling and make it easier to replace the logger implementation or mock it during testing.
